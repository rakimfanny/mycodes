# welcome to the project on "lead score" project 
this project is about guiding a CEO to increase the number of people that get converted to his educational company.
but how? we make a model and then predict from which feature he should be more expecting people to jpoin him 
logistic regression will be our model in this case 
followed by metrics for evaluation and ROC 
of course without forgetting data cleaning and data preparing
